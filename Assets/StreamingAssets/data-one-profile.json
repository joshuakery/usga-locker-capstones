Allan followed in the family tradition.\n\nRobertson famously completed in numerous high-stakes challenge matches. He took great delight in deliberately extending challenge matches to the 17th hole, when he could have polished off his foe earlier. He did so not only to avoid wounding his opponent’s pride, but also to make it impossible for the opponent to ask for better odds at their next match.",
