Allan followed in the family tradition.\n\nRobertson famously completed in numerous high-stakes challenge matches. He took great delight in deliberately extending challenge matches to the 17th hole, when he could have polished off his foe earlier. He did so not only to avoid wounding his opponent’s pride, but also to make it impossible for the opponent to ask for better odds at their next match.",

He is credited as the architect of more than 75 courses throughout the British Isles. He remained a premier player for decades, last playing in the Open Championship in 1896 at age 75.",

He was a excellent putter, but it was his powerful drives that most intimidated his peers. Allan Robertson, who refused to respond to Park's public challenge in 1853, once confessed, \"Willie frightens us with his long driving.\"",

The son of four-time Open Champion Willie Park, Sr., and nephew of 1870 Open Champion Mungo Park, Willie Park, Jr., was born into the \"First Family of Golf.\" His success was often attributed to exceptional putting, perfected through twelve-hour practice sessions.\n\nConfident, competitive and an iconoclast, Park never sought employment from a club, preferring instead to run his own business. He was an innovator in club and ball design and manufacturing, as well as golf course architecture, and parlayed his fame into business ventures that reached throughout the United Kingdom and extended to America.",

His swing was graceful and many contemporaries considered him the most stylish player of his era. But it was his stubbornness and dogged determination that made Ball a lion in match play. He retired with a match-play record of 99 wins against just 22 losses.",

But it was his dominance of English amateur golf, and his rivalry with John Ball, Jr., that earned him widespread fame.\n\nA wild swinger who re-gripped the club at the top of his backswing, Hilton owned a stellar match play record, boasting a 99-29 mark in amateur competitions. After retiring from competitive golf, Hilton authored several books on golf and became the founding editor of Golf Monthly and editor of Golf Illustrated.",

He toured the United States in 1900, 1913, and 1920, promoting awareness and driving growth of the game.\n\nVardon possessed one of the most admired and proficient golf swings the game has ever seen. He stood just 5'9\" tall and tipped the scales at 155 pounds, but he had enormous hands that melted perfectly around the club. His swing was more upright and his ball flight higher than his contemporaries, giving his approach shots the advantage of greater carry and softer landing.",

Taylor earned his spot in this so-called \"Great Triumvirate\" by winning the Open Championship five times, becoming the first professional from England to do so.\n\nTaylor's ability to play in wind and bad weather set him apart from his peers. He won his first Open Championship battling extreme wind and rain, while defeating Ted Ray by eight strokes. Bernard Darwin once characterized him as \"a man on wires, having to choke down his temper and often suffering agonies.\" Beloved by many, he dedicated his later life to writing books, making clubs, and designing courses.",

But once Braid won his first in 1901, there was no stopping him: He captured the Open again in 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1910, thus becoming the first man to raise the Claret Jug five times. \n\nBraid later turned to golf course architecture, designing or redesigning more than 200 courses, including Carnoustie, Royal Troon and the King's and Queen's courses at Gleneagles.",

          "bioText": "Charles Blair Macdonald, a \"founding father\" of American golf, was a driving force in the creation of the United States Golf Association in 1894. He was introduced to golf at age 16, when his parents sent him to live with his grandfather in St. Andrews, Scotland. He quickly became skilled enough to play regularly on the Old Course with two of the finest players of the day – Davey Strath and Young Tom Morris.\n\nSeveral years after Macdonald returned to the United States, he designed a seven-hole course for the 1892 World's Fair in Chicago, launching a career as a world-class architect. No less an authority than Bernard Darwin accurately referred to Macdonald as the first great American golf course architect.",
