While recovering in the hospital, he focused on thoughts of playing golf. He would go on to win 27 professional events, including three major championships.\n\nAfter he retired from competitive golf, Armour became one of the most successful instructors in the world.

He won the inaugural PGA Championship in 1916 and successfully defended the title the next time it was played in 1919. In 1921, he won the U.S. Open by nine strokes and four years later captured the 1925 Open Championship coming from five strokes back in the final round.\n\nBarnes was an intense, quiet competitor who often kept a sprig of clover clamped tightly between his teeth. In 1919, he authored *Picture Analysis of Golf Strokes*, revolutionary as the first golf instructional to make extensive use of photography.",

He wrote articles for *The Times* of London from 1907 until 1953 with the byline \"Our Golf Correspondent\" and wrote essays for *Country Life* from 1907 until 1961. \n\nA fine amateur golfer, Darwin competed in The Amateur Championship 26 times from 1898 to 1925, represented England in 8 international matches, and played for the Great Britain & Ireland Team in the 1922 Walker Cup as a last-minute substitute.",

His trademark style of putting, which came to be known as “Diegeling,” consisted of bending over at the waist and widely extending both arms with his elbows at right angles. \n\nDiegel’s peculiar technique earned him 30 PGA TOUR titles, including two PGA Championships, between 1920 and 1934. He also claimed four Canadian Open titles, as well as spots on four USA Ryder Cup Teams. After retiring in 1938, he became a club professional and worked with the U.S. Army during World War II to promote golf as a form of rehabilitation for wounded soldiers.",

In 1916, he became the first player to win the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur in the same year. Evans remained at the highest level of competitive golf for decades, competing in every U.S. Amateur from 1907 through 1962 and establishing the championship’s record for most matches won (57). \n\nWith the money Evans earned from producing golf instructional records and writing a golf book, he created a college scholarship for caddies. The Western Golf Association began administering the funds in 1929 and established the Evans Scholars Foundation, whose legacy includes helping more than 8,000 caddies receive a college education.",

He also captained the first six USA Ryder Cup Teams, posting a record of 7-1-1 in Ryder Cup competition. \n\nHagen is justifiably remembered for his devotion to raising the profile of golf professionals and growing the game through nationwide exhibitions. “I never wanted to be a millionaire,” Hagen once wrote, “I just wanted to live like one.”",

He brought new levels of attention to the game when, as a 20-year-old amateur, he defeated British legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in an 18-hole playoff at The Country Club in the 1913 U.S. Open. It would mark the first time that golf appeared on the front page of American newspapers.\n\nFollowing that historic victory, Ouimet went on to capture the U.S. Amateur in 1914 and 1931 while pursuing other business ventures. In 1951, he became the first non-Briton elected Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.",

          "bioText": "Born Eugenio Saraceni, the son of an Italian carpenter from Rome, Gene Sarazen spanned golf history as a competitor, innovator and senior statesman. He had a compact but ferocious swing and a fiercely competitive but generous heart.\n\nIn the final round of the 1935 Masters, Sarazen holed a miraculous shot from 220 yards for double eagle on the 15th hole. He finished the round tied with Craig Wood, then won the playoff the next day to become the first player to win all four major championships. \n\nIn 1931, while being taught by Howard Hughes how to fly a plane, Sarazen came upon the idea for the modern sand wedge. He later called it his biggest contribution to the game.",
          "quote": "When Sarazen saw a chance at the bacon hanging over the last green, he could put as much fire and fury into a finishing round as Jack Dempsey could put into a fight.",

He had a brilliant short game, but was erratic off the tee. In 1915, Travers became the second amateur to win the U.S. Open, but he chose to not defend his title and subsequently retired from competitive golf. \n\nAs Herbert Warren Wind explained, it was a fierce rivalry with Walter Travis that “formed the crucible in which a talented young golfer was made into the greatest match player of his decade.” Among his peers, Jerry Travers earned ultimate, almost intimidating, respect. Chick Evans called him “the coldest, hardest golfer I ever knew.”",

In 1924, Vare won 59 out of 60 matches, with her only loss coming on the 19th hole of the U.S. Women’s Amateur. Her dominance in match play was often attributed to her prodigious driving distances, which occasionally exceeded 300 yards.\n\nThe \"Queen of American Golf\" represented the United States on four USA Curtis Cup Teams and served as captain four times. In 1953, the LPGA introduced the Vare Trophy, which is awarded annually to the player achieving the lowest scoring average during a season.",
          "quote": "To make oneself a successful match player, there are certain qualities to be sought after, certain ideas must be kept in mind and certain phases of one’s attitude...The three I have taken are these: love of combat, serenity of mind and fearlessness.",

Bob Jones said she was the best golfer he had ever seen—man or woman. “It was not so much the score she made as the way she made it. It was impossible to expect that Miss Wethered would ever miss a shot,” Jones professed, “and she never did.”",
