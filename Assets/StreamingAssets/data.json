He collected 18 victories on the European Tour and 6 on the PGA TOUR, including two major championships.\n\nLyle won three times in his debut year of 1979, earning him Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year honors. In capturing the Open Championship in 1985, Lyle became the first British player to raise the Claret Jug since Tony Jacklin in 1969. Three years later at the Masters, Lyle recovered from a poor tee shot on the 18th hole to make a 10-foot birdie putt to become the first British golfer to win a Green Jacket.",

From 1977 to 1983, she recorded 82 top-ten finishes on the LPGA Tour. A noted clutch performer, she earned one-third of her LPGA titles in playoffs. She regards her victory in the 1984 U.S. Open as her most significant win, as she overcame a seven-stroke deficit to Amy Alcott and Rosie Jones with 13 holes left to play. \n\nStacy is the fourth-oldest of ten children, many of whom played golf competitively. In 1985, the Stacy family received a well-deserved Family of the Year honor from the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association.",

Her first win came at the 1969 U.S. Open, where she rallied from a five-shot deficit in the final round. In 1970, she became just the second woman to successfully defend her Women’s Open title. Caponi's best years came in 1980 and 1981, when she capped off her career with five victories in each year. \n\nAfter retiring from competitive golf in 1988, Caponi turned to television broadcasting and served as an analyst for CBS Sports and the Golf Channel. In 2005, Nancy Lopez named her assistant captain to the USA Solheim Cup team, which went on to defeat Europe 15½ to 12½.",

She entered the final round tied for the lead and played her way to a three-stroke victory over Sandra Post and fellow Hall of Fame members Pat Bradley and Judy Rankin. \n\nA founding member of the LPGA Tour of Japan in 1968, Higuchi dominated the JLPGA from the late 1960s to the 1980s. She won 69 tournaments on the JLPGA tour, 18 of which were JLPGA major championships, and earned two victories on the LPGA Tour. Four years after playing her last competitive tournament in 1990, Higuchi was named the commissioner of the JLPGA.",

She turned professional two years later, winning the 1975 Orange Blossom Classic during her rookie year. \n\nAlcott would go on to collect 28 LPGA Tour titles, including five major championships, leaving her lasting legacy at the Nabisco Dinah Shore Classic. After her win in 1988, Alcott jumped into Poppie’s Pond, located off the 18th green at the Mission Hills Country Club. In 1991 along with tournament host Dinah Shore, Alcott jumped in again, and the spontaneous leap began by Alcott became a tradition for all champions after 1995.",

She appeared in a handful of feature films that launched her four-decade career in American television.\n\nIn 1972, Colgate's chairman David Foster approached Shore to host a new tournament for the LPGA Tour. She agreed and became an engaged leader of the Colgate Dinah Shore Championship.

He competed on nine Walker Cup teams for Great Britain & Ireland between 1957 and 1973, winning as playing captain in 1971. \n\nBonallack's enduring impact followed his retirement from competitive golf, when he emerged as one of the game's leading administrators, serving as president of the English Golf Union and PGA of Great Britain and Ireland, and then as chairman of the British Golf Foundation. These positions laid the groundwork for Bonallack to become the Secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews from 1983 to 1999, and he would be named the millennium captain in 2000.",

In 1976, Rankin won six times, becoming the first player to win more than $100,000 during one season. In 1977, she recorded 25 top-10 finishes. \n\nAfter retiring from competitive golf, Rankin joined ABC Sports as a commentator and beginning in 2010, took over as lead LPGA analyst for the Golf Channel. Rankin also captained victorious Solheim Cup teams in 1996 and 1998, and called her service as captain “the greatest reward after the end of a fine career.”",

She won 39 times between 1962 and 1975, but stepped away in 1977 due to an ulcer and circulation problems in her left hand. \n\nHaynie completed her comeback in 1981 by winning the Henredon Classic, and in 1982 she won back-to-back tournaments, the Rochester International and the Peter Jackson Classic to cap off her career. Her knee gave out in 1984, and in 1985 she underwent electrode treatment to deaden the sensitivity in her lower back. Haynie passed the $1 million mark in career earnings in 1988, and then left the game on her own terms at last in 1989.",

He was also known for making big putts when they mattered most, using a distinctive split-handed grip and an old hickory-shafted blade. In 1971, he captured his first PGA Tour title at the Houston Champions International, helping him to secure Rookie-of-the-Year honors. He would go on to record 19 PGA TOUR victories, with his last win coming at the 1985 PGA Championship.\n\nGreen played on three USA Ryder Cup teams, going undefeated in singles play. He captured four tournaments from 1998 to 2002 on PGA TOUR Champions before retiring from competitive golf in 2009.",

His reputation as a fierce competitor was established during his amateur career, with victories in the 1970 U.S Amateur and Western Amateur. During the 1977 PGA Championship, Wadkins won the first sudden-death playoff in the stroke-play era of major championships on the third extra hole at Pebble Beach. The highlights of his career were his Ryder Cup appearances, where he boasted a 22-11-3 record as an eight-time member of the USA Team between 1977 and 1993. \n\nWadkins began his broadcast career for CBS Sports in 2000, and he joined Golf Channel and NBC as their PGA TOUR Champions lead analyst in 2011.",

He also competed on five victorious USA Ryder Cup teams, posting a record of 13-5-2. \n\nIn 1974, Irwin survived the “Massacre at Winged Foot” to earn his first U.S. Open win by two strokes. In 1990 at Medinah, he became the oldest U.S. Open champion at age 45. He sank a 45-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to force an 18-hole playoff with Mike Donald, then, after finishing the playoff still tied, sealed the victory with birdie putt on the first sudden-death hole in U.S. Open history.",

Stewart turned professional in 1979, but his breakthrough did not come until 1989 when he won the PGA Championship after starting the final round six strokes behind. \n\nTwo years later, Stewart secured his first U.S. Open title in a playoff at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota. HIs most memorable victory came in 1999, when he dueled with Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods over the closing holes of Pinehurst No. 2 before holing a memorable par putt on the 72nd green to secure the U.S. Open title. He died four months later in an aviation accident.",

Overdue to win a major after 11 years on tour, he broke through to win the 1984 Masters. An emotional triumph came 11 years later when Crenshaw earned his second Masters with the help of his long-time coach and mentor Harvey Penick, who gave Crenshaw one last putting lesson before passing away. \n\nAfter playing on three USA Ryder teams during the 1980s, Crenshaw's defining Ryder Cup moment came in 1999 when he captained the Americans to a dramatic win over Europe. The team trailed by four points heading into the Sunday singles matches, but earned 8.5 points to complete a then-record comeback.",

He was the leading money winner on the Japan Golf Tour twelve times from 1973 to 1993. He claimed his 100th professional victory at the 1996 Dunlop Phoenix. In 2002, Ozaki captured the final title of his career at the ANA Open, which he won for the seventh time.",

Bush, the 41st President of the United States, continued his family’s rich legacy of golf leadership, as well the 100-year tradition of White House golfers. George Herbert Walker, his grandfather, served as president of the USGA in 1920, notably donating the Walker Cup for competition between the USA and Great Britain. Prescott Bush, his father who taught him to play golf, served as president of the USGA in 1935.\n\nPresident Bush was a low-handicap golfer, known for his fast pace on the golf course, often completing eighteen holes in less than two hours. He was a strong advocate for The First Tee, the game’s most successful youth access program, and served as the first honorary chairman in 1997.",

In 1986, Bradley became the first woman to claim three modern major titles in the same year. In so doing, she became just the third player, following Louise Suggs and Mickey Wright, to complete the LPGA’s career Grand Slam.\n\nBradley’s career was interrupted at its peak by a severe case of Graves' Disease (hyperthyroidism) in 1987 that left her unable to swing a club and barely able to walk. Remarkably, she returned to form, going on to become the first female player to reach $3 million and $4 million in career earnings.",

Two years later, she claimed her first major at the 1987 U.S. Women’s Open in an 18-hole playoff against fellow Hall of Fame members Ayako Okamoto and JoAnne Carner. She would go on to win more than 80 times worldwide, including four major championships.\n\nDavies participated on 12 European Solheim Cup teams from 1990 to 2011, scoring a record 25 points over 46 matches with an overall mark of 22-18-6. In 2014, Davies was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, England’s highest civilian honor.",

After winning 20 times in Japan, Okamoto joined the LPGA in 1982, claiming her first victory at the Arizona Copper Classic. She would go on to capture 62 tournaments worldwide.\n\nOkamoto’s best year came in 1987, when she captured four titles, finished at the top of the money list, and became the first non-American to win the Rolex Player of the Year Award. A true inspiration to several generations of Japanese golfers, Okamoto leveraged her superstar status to grow the game in Japan and coach and support future stars of Japanese golf.",

He played on the Wake Forest golf team—regarded as one of the best collegiate teams ever—and was a three-time All American, winning the NCAA individual title in 1974. \n\nIn 1988, Strange won four times to earn Player of the Year honors and became the first player to earn more than $1 million dollars in a single season. His most significant career achievements came in 1988 and 1989, when he became the first player since Ben Hogan to successfully defend the U.S. Open title. Following his playing career, Strange became a golf analyst for ABC, ESPN and FOX Sports.",
