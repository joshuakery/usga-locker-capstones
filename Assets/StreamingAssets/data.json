He was a excellent putter, but it was his powerful drives that most intimidated his peers.

But it was his dominance of English amateur golf, and his rivalry with John Ball, Jr., that earned him widespread fame.\n\nA wild swinger who re-gripped the club at the top of his backswing, Hilton owned a stellar match play record, boasting a 99-29 mark in amateur competitions. After retiring from competitive golf, Hilton authored several books on golf and became the founding editor of Golf Monthly and editor of Golf Illustrated.",

          "bioText": "Charles Blair Macdonald, a \"founding father\" of American golf, was a driving force in the creation of the United States Golf Association in 1894. He was introduced to golf at age 16, when his parents sent him to live with his grandfather in St. Andrews, Scotland. He quickly became skilled enough to play regularly on the Old Course with two of the finest players of the day – Davey Strath and Young Tom Morris.\n\nSeveral years after Macdonald returned to the United States, he designed a seven-hole course for the 1892 World's Fair in Chicago, launching a career as a world-class architect. No less an authority than Bernard Darwin accurately referred to Macdonald as the first great American golf course architect.",
