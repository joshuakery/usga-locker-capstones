Two years later, at the Bank of America Colonial, she became the first woman to play on the PGA TOUR since Babe Zaharias in 1945. Later in 2003, she became just the sixth woman to complete the LPGA career Grand Slam. \n\nSorenstam, who played on eight Solheim Cup teams for Europe from 1994 to 2007, is tied with Laura Davies for most matches won (22) and served as team captain in 2017.",

He demonstrated great potential from a young age, winning the Junior World Golf Championship's 13-14-year-old division in 1984. With his victories in the 1994 and 1997 U.S. Open and 2002 and 2012 Open Championship, Els became just the eighth player to win a major championship in three different decades.\n\nEls led the European Tour Order of Merit in 2003 and 2004 and in 2014 became the first to surpass €30 million in career earnings on the European Tour. He played on eight International Teams in the Presidents Cup from 1996 to 2011.",

After attending North Texas University, he competed on the South African Tour with the goal of eventually qualifying for the PGA TOUR.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck on July 21, 1974, when Walters was thrown from a golf cart and left paralyzed from the waist down. True to his favorite expression, Walters “found a new dream” and learned to play from a modified golf cart. Over the next forty-five years, “The Dennis Walters Golf Show” traveled more three-and-a-half million miles and made more than 3,000 appearances where Walters performed trick shots. He won the seated division of the inaugural U.S. Adaptive Open at Pinehurst in 2022.",
