He excelled at golf despite injuries he suffered in World War I that left him with sight in only one eye and metal plates in his head and arm. While recovering in the hospital, he focused on thoughts of playing golf. He would go on to win 27 professional events, including three major championships.\n\nAfter he retired from competitive golf, Armour became one of the most successful instructors in the world. The philosophies and techniques that he taught were detailed in his best-selling book, **How to Play Your Best Golf All the Time.**",

He won the inaugural PGA Championship in 1916 and successfully defended the title the next time it was played in 1919. In 1921, he won the U.S. Open by nine strokes and four years later captured the 1925 Open Championship coming from five strokes back in the final round.\n\nBarnes was an intense, quiet competitor who often kept a sprig of clover clamped tightly between his teeth. In 1919, he authored **Picture Analysis of Golf Strokes**, revolutionary as the first golf instructional to make extensive use of photography.",

He also claimed four Canadian Open titles, as well as spots on four USA Ryder Cup Teams. After retiring in 1938, he became a club professional and worked with the U.S. Army during World War II to promote golf as a form of rehabilitation for wounded soldiers.",

In 1916, he became the first player to win the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur in the same year. Evans remained at the highest level of competitive golf for decades, competing in every U.S. Amateur from 1907 through 1962 and establishing the championship’s record for most matches won (57). \n\nWith the money Evans earned from producing golf instructional records and writing a golf book, he created a college scholarship for caddies. The Western Golf Association began administering the funds in 1929 and established the Evans Scholars Foundation, whose legacy includes helping more than 8,000 caddies receive a college education.",

He would go on to win 14 tournaments on the PGA TOUR, including two consecutive major championships. In 1921, Hutchinson became the first U.S.-based player to capture the Claret Jug with his victory at the 1921 Open Championship. \n\nKnown around the course as \"Jovial Jock,\" Hutchison won the inaugural Senior PGA Championship in 1937, and did so again in 1947. He returned to Augusta National Golf Club–the site of his 1937 victory–when he joined 1908 U.S. Open champion Fred McLeod as the first honorary starters at the Masters in 1963.",

He brought new levels of attention to the game when, as a 20-year-old amateur, he defeated British legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in an 18-hole playoff at The Country Club in the 1913 U.S. Open. It would mark the first time that golf appeared on the front page of American newspapers.\n\nFollowing that historic victory, Ouimet went on to capture the U.S. Amateur in 1914 and 1931 while pursuing other business ventures. In 1951, he became the first non-Briton elected Captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews.",

He had a compact but ferocious swing and a fiercely competitive but generous heart.\n\nIn the final round of the 1935 Masters, Sarazen holed a miraculous shot from 220 yards for double eagle on the 15th hole. He finished the round tied with Craig Wood, then won the playoff the next day to become the first player to win all four major championships. \n\nIn 1931, while being taught by Howard Hughes how to fly a plane, Sarazen came upon the idea for the modern sand wedge. He later called it his biggest contribution to the game.",

He had a brilliant short game, but was erratic off the tee. In 1915, Travers became the second amateur to win the U.S. Open, but he chose to not defend his title and subsequently retired from competitive golf. \n\nAs Herbert Warren Wind explained, it was a fierce rivalry with Walter Travis that “formed the crucible in which a talented young golfer was made into the greatest match player of his decade.” Among his peers, Jerry Travers earned ultimate, almost intimidating, respect. Chick Evans called him “the coldest, hardest golfer I ever knew.”",
