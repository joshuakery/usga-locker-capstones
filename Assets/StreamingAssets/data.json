Like many professionals of his era, Park was introduced to golf as a caddie, using a whittled stick as his first club.\n\nTall and strong, he soon emerged as one of the most dominant golfers of his generation, gaining notoriety through his victories in challenge matches against contemporaries such as Allan Robertson, Willie Dunn and Old Tom Morris. He was a excellent putter, but it was his powerful drives that most intimidated his peers. Allan Robertson, who refused to respond to Park's public challenge in 1853, once confessed, \"Willie frightens us with his long driving.\"",

He was golf’s first international superstar, winning a record six Open Championship titles between 1896 and 1914. He toured the United States in 1900, 1913, and 1920, promoting awareness and driving growth of the game.\n\nVardon possessed one of the most admired and proficient golf swings the game has ever seen. He stood just 5'9\" tall and tipped the scales at 155 pounds, but he had enormous hands that melted perfectly around the club. His swing was more upright and his ball flight higher than his contemporaries, giving his approach shots the advantage of greater carry and softer landing.",
