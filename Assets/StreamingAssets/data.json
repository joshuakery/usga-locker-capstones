Darwin initially practiced law in London, but after a few years decided to change his career to journalism, and more specifically, to write about golf. He wrote articles for The Times of London from 1907 until 1953 with the byline \"Our Golf Correspondent\" and wrote essays for Country Life from 1907 until 1961. \n\nA fine amateur golfer, Darwin competed in the British Amateur 26 times from 1898 to 1925, represented England in 8 international matches, and played for the Great Britain and Ireland team in the 1922 Walker Cup as a last-minute substitute.",

Regarded by many as the premier golf architect in America during the early 20th century, Ross designed over 400 courses that collectively hosted dozens of prestigious events such as the U.S. Open, U.S. Women’s Open, PGA Championship and Ryder Cup. \n\nA native of Scotland, Ross met a Harvard professor who persuaded him in 1899 to come to America and helped him find his first job at Oakley Country Club. His architecture career blossomed after 1900, when James Walker Tufts, the founder of Pinehurst, lured Ross to the Sand Hills and commissioned from him the design of four golf courses.",

He had a compact but ferocious swing and a fiercely competitive but generous heart.\n\nIn the final round of the 1935 Masters, Sarazen holed a miraculous shot from 220 yards for double eagle on the 15th hole. He finished the round tied with Craig Wood, then won the playoff the next day to become the first player to win all four major championships. \n\nIn 1931, while being taught by Howard Hughes how to fly a plane, Sarazen came upon the idea for the modern sand wedge. He later called it his biggest contribution to the game.",

He had a brilliant short game, but was erratic off the tee. In 1915, Travers became the second amateur to win the U.S. Open, but he chose to not defend his title and subsequently retired from competitive golf. \n\nAs Herbert Warren Wind explained, it was a fierce rivalry with Walter Travis that “formed the crucible in which a talented young golfer was made into the greatest match player of his decade.” Among his peers, Jerry Travers earned ultimate, almost intimidating, respect. Chick Evans called him “the coldest, hardest golfer I ever knew.”",
