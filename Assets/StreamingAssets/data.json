He took great delight in deliberately extending challenge matches to the 17th hole, when he could have polished off his foe earlier. He did so not only to avoid wounding his opponent’s pride, but also to make it impossible for the opponent to ask for better odds at their next match.",

He is credited as the architect of more than 75 courses throughout the British Isles. He remained a premier player for decades, last playing in The Open Championship in 1896 at age 75.",

Like many professionals of his era, Park was introduced to golf as a caddie, using a whittled stick as his first club.\n\nTall and strong, he soon emerged as one of the most dominant golfers of his generation, gaining notoriety through his victories in challenge matches against contemporaries such as Allan Robertson, Willie Dunn Sr. and Old Tom Morris. He was an excellent putter, but it was his powerful drives that most intimidated his peers. Allan Robertson, who refused to respond to Park's public challenge in 1853, once confessed, \"Willie frightens us with his long driving.\"",

He was an innovator in club and ball design and manufacturing, as well as golf course architecture, and parlayed his fame into business ventures that reached throughout the United Kingdom and extended to America.",

          "bioText": "A fierce competitor, known for his fiery temper and determined spirit, Englishman John Ball Jr. dominated amateur golf in late nineteenth-century Great Britain, winning eight Amateur Championships between 1888 and 1912, The Open Championship in 1890 and the hearts and respect of his country.\n\nBall learned the game on the links at Holyoke, competing against his rival and friend, Harold Hilton. His swing was graceful and many contemporaries considered him the most stylish player of his era. But it was his stubbornness and dogged determination that made Ball a lion in match play. He retired with a match-play record of 99 wins against just 22 losses.",

But it was his dominance of English amateur golf, and his rivalry with John Ball Jr., that earned him widespread fame.\n\nA wild swinger who re-gripped the club at the top of his backswing, Hilton owned a stellar match play record, boasting a 99-29 mark in amateur competitions. After retiring from competitive golf, Hilton authored several books on golf and became the founding editor of **Golf Monthly** and editor of **Golf Illustrated.**",

He stood just 5-foot-9 and tipped the scales at 155 pounds, but he had enormous hands that melted perfectly around the club. His swing was more upright and his ball flight higher than his contemporaries, giving his approach shots the advantage of greater carry and softer landings.",

Taylor earned his spot in this so-called \"Great Triumvirate\" by winning The Open Championship five times, becoming the first professional from England to do so.\n\nTaylor's ability to play in wind and bad weather set him apart from his peers. He won his last Open Championship in 1913 battling extreme wind and rain, while defeating Ted Ray by eight strokes. Bernard Darwin once characterized him as \"a man on wires, having to choke down his temper and often suffering agonies.\" Beloved by many, he dedicated his later life to writing books, making clubs and designing courses.",

As a golfer, he was a late bloomer, not winning his first Open Championship until Harry Vardon and J.H. Taylor had already won three each. But once Braid won his first in 1901, there was no stopping him. He captured the Open again in 1905, 1906, 1908 and 1910, thus becoming the first man to raise the Claret Jug five times. \n\nBraid later turned to golf course architecture, designing or redesigning more than 200 courses, including Carnoustie, Royal Troon and the King's and Queen's courses at Gleneagles.",

From 1897 to 1910, Anderson won the U. S. Open four times, finished second once, third once, fourth twice and fifth three times. He was, in many respects, the first dominant professional in America.\n\nReared on the links of North Berwick, Scotland, Anderson was a sturdy man with muscular shoulders, brawny forearms and exceptionally large hands. He played with a flat, full-sweeping action known as the \"St. Andrews swing.\" Despite what many considered to be swing flaws, Anderson was consistently accurate. He died prematurely of arteriosclerosis at age 31.",

He was introduced to golf at age 16, when his parents sent him to live with his grandfather in St. Andrews, Scotland. He quickly became skilled enough to play regularly on the Old Course with two of the finest players of the day—Davey Strath and Young Tom Morris.\n\nSeveral years after Macdonald returned to the United States, he designed a seven-hole course for the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, launching a career as a world-class architect. No less an authority than Bernard Darwin accurately referred to Macdonald as the first great American golf course architect.",
